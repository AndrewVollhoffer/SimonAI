Currently two very simple scripts that allow you to create and call methods that will automatically input keystrokes and listen to voice to automatically play Smash64 or Diddy Kong Racing.

Smash64: 
	- install Pynput library
	
Diddy Kong Racing: 
	- install Pynput
	- install Vosk library
	- download a Vosk model
	- change model path to model folder
