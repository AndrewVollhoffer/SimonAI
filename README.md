Currently two very simple scripts that allow you to create and call methods that will automatically input keystrokes and listen to voice to automatically play Smash64 or Diddy Kong Racing.

Smash64: No setup needed.
Diddy Kong Racing: You will need to download a Vosk model to use with the recognizer.

Dubbed SIMONAI after a past coworker.

Should work on Windows and Linux while sudo user.
